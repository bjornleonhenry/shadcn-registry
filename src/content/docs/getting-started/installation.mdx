description: How to install WDS Shadcn components in your project.

import CliCommandCode from "@/components/markdown/cli-command-code/cli-command-code.astro"
import { SERVER_URL } from "@/data/env"

It doesn't matter what framework or package manager you are using. Installing WDS Shadcn components is as simple as running the `shadcn add @wds/<component>` command and replacing `<component>` with the name of the component you want to install.

The entire install process is handled by the `shadcn` CLI tool and works identically to how you would install any other Shadcn component.

## Example

<CliCommandCode action="run" command="shadcn@latest add @wds/action-button" />

_If that doesn't work you can use the full URL to the component's JSON file instead._

<CliCommandCode
  action="run"
  command={`shadcn@latest add ${SERVER_URL}/r/action-button.json`}
/>
