<Steps>

1. **Search Existing Issues**

   Review the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/wds-shadcn-registry/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aenhancement) to see if the feature has already been requested.

2. **Open a Issue**

   Go to the GitHub repository and [open a new issue](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/wds-shadcn-registry/issues) using the `Feature Request` template.

3. **Describe the Feature**

   Explain the motivation, expected behavior, and possible alternatives. The more detailed a request is, the easier it is for maintainers to understand and implement.
