<Steps>

1. **Check Existing Components**

   Review the [components list](/components) and the [GitHub discussions tab](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/wds-shadcn-registry/discussions/categories/component-request) to see if the component is already implemented or requested.

2. **Open a Discussion**

   Go to the GitHub repository and [start a new discussion](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/wds-shadcn-registry/discussions/new?category=component-request).

3. **Describe the Component**

   Provide a clear description, use cases, and any references or examples. The more detailed a request is, the easier it is for maintainers to understand and implement.
